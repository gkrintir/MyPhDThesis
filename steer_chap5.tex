\chapter{Measurement of the \ttbar\ cross section in \texttt{LHC} pp collisions at 5.02\,TeV}
\minitoc

\InitialCharacter{T}his Chapter reports the top quark pair production cross section (\stt) measured, for the first time,
in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The data were collected by the \texttt{CMS} experiment
and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 27.4\,\invpb.  The measurement is performed by analyzing events with at least one charged lepton. 
The measured cross section is $ \stt  =  69.5 \pm 6.1\,(\stat)\pm 5.6\,(\syst)\pm 1.6\,(\lumi)\,\pb$, in agreement with the expectation from the standard model. 
With a total relative uncertainty of 12\% in the final result the impact of the presented measurement on the determination of the gluon distribution function 
is also investigated at the next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics.

The original contribution from the present thesis to the material related to the following Chapter and listed in \hyperref[hellobiblio]{Scientific output} and \hyperref[hellobiblio1]{Internal notes} is:

\begin{itemize}

\item The first preliminary measurement in the \empm\ final state alone. 
\item The updated measurement in the $\ell$+jets final state.
\item The entire responsibility of all internal stages that the paper had to pass through before it left the Collaboration and after the interaction with the journal.

\end{itemize}
