  Summary of the impacts and pulls of the most significant nuisance parameters used in the count analysis, when the fit is performed to the Asimov data set.
  In each plot the left panel shows the post-fit pull (value and uncertainty) of each nuisance, while the right panel displays the estimated impact on the fit for the signal strength.
  Only the first 30 nuisances are displayed, being their name shown at each row of the plots~\citeTH{topobs_CMS_jhep}.
