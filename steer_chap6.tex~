\chapter{Observation of top quark production in proton-nucleus collisions}
\minitoc

\InitialCharacter{T}he first observation of top quark production in proton-nucleus collisions is reported in this Chapter,
using proton-lead data collected by the \texttt{CMS} experiment at the \texttt{CERN} \texttt{LHC} at a
 nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\rootsNN = 8.16$\,\TeV. The measurement is performed using events with exactly one isolated electron or muon candidate and at least four jets. 
The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 
174\,\nbinv. The significance of the $\ttbar$ signal against the background-only hypothesis is above five standard deviations. 
The measured cross section is $\stt = 45 \pm 8$\,$\mathrm{nb}$, consistent with predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics.

The original contribution from the present thesis to the material related to the following Chapter and listed in \hyperref[hellobiblio]{Scientific output} and \hyperref[hellobiblio1]{Internal notes} is:

\begin{itemize}

\item The measurement in the $\ell$+jets final state. 
\item The entire responsibility of the signal and background event generation. For that purpose, the default configuration of the used NLO generator had to be further tuned
  to include nuclear modifacations on the gluon PDF.
\item The partial responsibility of the internal stages that the paper had to pass through before it left the Collaboration and after the interaction with the journal
  to ensure that it communicated physics with clarity.

\end{itemize}
