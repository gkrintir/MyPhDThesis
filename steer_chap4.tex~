\InitialCharacter{A} system consisting of five detectors to monitor and measure the luminosity delivered by \texttt{LHC} is currently in use at the \texttt{CMS} experiment. 
%Based on rate measurements for a variety of observables this system includes: a)  the CMS silicon pixel detector, b) the drift tube (\texttt{DT}) chambers, 
%c) the forward hadron (\texttt{HF}) calorimeter, d) the Fast Beam Conditions Monitor (\texttt{BCM1F}), and e) the recently installed and commissioned Pixel Luminosity Telescope (\texttt{PLT}).
On the one hand, the \texttt{BCM1F}, \texttt{HF}, and \texttt{PLT} detectors are characterized by an independent high-rate data acquisition system,
and hence serve as excellent real time monitoring systems for luminosity.
On the other hand, the silicon pixel detector and \texttt{DT} feature very low occupancy and good stability over time.
Absolute calibrations of the luminometers are established by performing van der Meer (vdM) scans typically with dedicated \texttt{LHC} machine setups. 
Scanning the two beams through one another in the transverse plane of the detector the vdM technique allows to measure the luminosity per colliding bunch pair directly from the machine parameters. 

The calibration of the integrated luminosity delivered to the \texttt{CMS} experiment during the proton-proton (pp), and the lead-proton (Pbp) and proton-lead (pPb) periods at 
$\sqrt{s}=5.02$ and $\rootsNN=8.16$\,\TeV, respectively, is presented in this Chapter. Three different subdetectors are used: the \texttt{HF} calorimeter, \texttt{PLT}, 
and the silicon tracker. Visible cross sections are obtained using the \texttt{vdM} procedure for measuring the luminometer rate as a function of the beam separation. 
After taking into account the effects due to horizontal--vertical beam correlations, bunch-to-bunch and scan-to-scan variations, spurious charges, adjustments of the length scale measurements 
provided by \texttt{LHC} magnet currents, and beam--beam effects, an overall uncertainty of 2.3, 3.2 and 3.7\% is assessed in pp, Pbp and pPb periods, respectively,
while the total ``Pbp+pPb'' uncertainty is found to be 3.5\%, combining the visible cross sections in the two separate periods. 
 Time stability of these calibrations is considered and included in the final systematic uncertainty.

 The material in the following Chapter, as documented in \hyperref[hellobiblio]{Scientific output} and \hyperref[hellobiblio1]{Internal notes}, relies almost exclusively on a original contribution.
 Each study is subjected to an exhaustive internal review from early analysis to publication,  including several fixed waypoints that had to be additionally met.
