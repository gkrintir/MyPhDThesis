The measurement of the inclusive cross section is affected by systematic uncertainties that are assessed individually and originate from detector effects or theory assumptions. 
We describe in more detail the assessment of the systematic uncertainties below.

\subsection{Experimental uncertainty}
\label{subsec:expuncs}

The uncertainties in the lepton trigger, reconstrunction, and identification efficiencies are estimated with a tag-and-probe method (see Appendices~\ref{sec:tnp_eles} and~\ref{sec:tnp_mus}). 
The total uncertainty is dominated by the dependency of charged lepton isolation on the underlying event.

The uncertainty due to the calibration of the jet energy scale has been estimated by a change of 5\% in the jet energies, independent of the \pt and $\eta$ of the jet. 
This takes into account a 3\%-level difference between the reconstructed and generated jet energy in MC events (Fig.~\ref{UE:a}), 
and a 3\% residual calibration uncertainty from data~\cite{CMS-DP-2018-028}. 
The uncertainty due to the limited accuracy of the jet energy resolution is determined by changing the JER correction from the nominal value within $\pm 1$ standard deviation, 
depending on the \pt and $\eta$ of the jet. We assume the 13\,\TeV\ values given that the JER degradation is mostly induced by detector effects. 
The parameterizations and associated uncertainties are described in Section~\ref{sec:jets} and Ref.~\cite{CMS-DP-2018-028}, respectively. 
The effect on our analysis is estimated to be $<1\%$.

Uncertainties in the background are included in the fit uncertainty, as the background normalization and distribution are determined \textit{in-situ}.  
The b tagging efficiency is also considered as a separate source of experimental uncertainty in the measurement; is measured \textit{in-situ} and 
bears the largest effect on the \ttbar\ cross section;

The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity has been initially estimated to be 5\% at the time of the submission to the journal, 
while the central value remained essentially unchanged~\citeTH{CMS-PAS-LUM-17-002}. 
The 0.1\% uncertainty in the \texttt{LHC} beam energy~\cite{Wenninger:2254678} has a numerically insignificant effect on this measurement.

\subsection{Theory uncertainty}
\label{subsec:msigodeluncertainties}

The modeling of the \ttbar\ signal events is an essential ingredient in the measurement as we rely on the expected acceptance and fraction of correct to wrong assignments. 
The impact of theoretical assumptions in the modeling is determined by repeating the analysis selection using the NLO \POWHEG simulation. 
The differences found are small, and are accounted for as a systematic uncertainty.

The effect of the jet energy scale in the signal is included by varying the \mjj distributions by a multiplicative factor as
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{\mjj}=(1+\delta_{JSF} \times \theta_{JSF}) \times \mjj\, ,
\label{eq:scaledmjj}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{JSF}$ is the estimated effect of the jet energy scale on the invariant mass of the two jets in the event, 
after propagating the jet energy scale uncertainty, and $\theta_{JSF}$ is a nuisance parameter, Gaussian-distributed with mean and width of zero and unity, respectively.

The effect of the jet energy scale on the acceptance is estimated separately from its effect on the \mjj distributions,
by counting the events that pass the pre-selection when the jet energy scale is varied according to its uncertainties. 
This results in an additional 3\% uncertainty in the acceptance that is not correlated in the fit with the JES impact on the \mjj distribution since 
it pertains an extrapolation from the fiducial to the full phase space.

The uncertainty from the choice of free- and bound-proton PDF is determined by reweighting the sample of simulated \ttbar\ events according to the RMS of 
the CT14 and EPPS16 replicas. Two extra variations of $\alpha_{\textrm{s}}(M_{\mathrm{Z}})$ are added in quadrature, to determine the total PDF uncertainty. 
Variation of the $\mu_\textrm{R}/\mu_\textrm{F}$ scales in the \ttbar\ simulation is also taken into account.
