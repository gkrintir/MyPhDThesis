In this section, the fit model applied to extract the inclusive \stt is discussed. 
The \ttbar\ MC simulation is used to guide the parameterization of the signal, while the shape of the background is estimated \textit{in-situ} from the data.
The normalization of both signal and background is left to float freely.
The efficiency of the \cPqb-identification algorithm is measured simultaneously with the signal cross section, and hence it is also data-based estimated. 
The background from \QCD\ multijet and \PW+jets events are controlled by counting the number of jets identified as originating from \cPqb\ quarks.

For each mass variable, i.e., \mjj, $m_{\cPqt_{\textrm{had}}}$ and $m_{\cPqt_{\textrm{lep}}}$, the \ttbar\ MC simulation is used to estimate the expected contributions from correctly or wrongly assigned pairs. 
Independently of the variable and event category it is seen that a Crystal-Ball function~\cite{SLAC-R-236} 
summed with a Gamma function is able to model the spectrum of correct assigned pairs precisely, whereas wrongly assigned pairs are described with a bifurcated Gaussian, i.e., 
a Gaussian with different widths to the left and right of its mean summed with a Landau function.
The definition of the pdfs and the routines used to adjust the parameters are based on \textsc{RooFit}~\cite{roofit}.

Figures~\ref{fig:sigparam_mjj},~\ref{fig:sigparam_mthad} and~\ref{fig:sigparam_mtlep} show the results of the parameterizations obtained for the different event categories used in
the analysis.
The separation between correct and wrong assigned pairs serves only illustrative purposes.
Their ratio is determined by a fit to the signal MC, while its magnitude has no effect on the final result.
The figures span a wide mass range mostly to highlight the expectations from the simulation for the signal.
The fits to the data are performed within a smaller range to ensure their stability.

In Table~\ref{tab:sigparam} the main parameters for the spectrum of correct assignments are summarized. 
The effective width is computed from the cumulative distribution function (CDF); half of the 68\% CL derived from the CDF is quoted as the effective width of the distribution. 
It can be seen that for the \mjj and $m_{\cPqt_{\textrm{had}}}$ variables the main parameters are quite similar across all event categories. 
The largest variations are related to the 0\cPqb{} where the event count of the MC simulation may induce statistical fluctuations in the parameterizations. 
Given this category is signal depleted and is used only for controlling the background no significant impact in the analysis is expected.

\subsection{Background parameterization}
\label{sec:bkg_pPb}

\subsubsection{\PW+jets background}
\label{sec:bkg_Wjets}

The MC simulation is used to seed the parameters of the \PW+jets background modeling. 
Once a functional form is derived, its parameters and normalization are determined from the fit to the data. 
This approach is justified on the grounds of the nonaccurate simulation in the phase space of the analysis, i.e, 
simulations rely on the \PYTHIA parton shower to predict most of the jets in the \ttbar\ signal region. 
Therefore the simulation could bias both the rate and the shape of \PW+heavy flavor production.

From the MC simulation, a Landau pdf~\cite{roofit} is found to describe reasonably well the contribution from \PW+jets in all mass variables. 
Figure~\ref{fig:wparammc} compares the \PW{}+jets simulated events with the Landau pdf fit superimposed. 
Because of the low event count, the fit is performed using events with no \cPqb-tagged jets; a fair agreement is observed between the pdf and the simulation. 
It can also be noticed that the Landau parameters differ only slightly with respect to those obtained for the wrong assignment component of the signal, 
as described in the previous Section and shown in the same Figure. This is not surprising given the combinatorial nature of the \PW+jets background.

The superimposed gray curve corresponds to the parametrized contribution from wrong assignments in the \ttbar\ signal process~\citeAN{AN-17-043}.
}
\label{fig:wparammc}
\end{figure}

The higher event count \PW+jets LO sample using pp collisions at 8\,\TeV\ validates the Landau parameterization. 
Figure~\ref{fig:wshapevar} shows the relative difference in the shape of the three mass distributions in the $1\ell$4j1\cPqb and $1\ell$4j2\cPqb 
with respect to the $1\ell$4j0\cPqb event category. 
The largest deviations are seen for \mjj and $m_{\cPqt_{\textrm{lep}}}$ variables. 
The former indicates that the kinematics of the jets in a heavy-flavor enriched region are harder with respect to the light-flavor region, 
while the latter is expected as \cPqb-jets tend to contribute to real \ptmiss through semileptonic \cPqb quark decays.

  while the red lines represent first order polynomial fits to the ratios~\citeAN{AN-17-043}.
}
\label{fig:wshapevar}
\end{figure}

The relative differences in Fig.~\ref{fig:wshapevar}, as extracted using pp collisions, are used to extrapolate the \PW+jets distributions from the $1\ell$4j0\cPqb 
to the $1\ell$4j1\cPqb and $1\ell$4j2\cPqb event categories; each simulated \PYTHIA event falling in the $1\ell$4j0\cPqb category is reweighted according to the value of the relative difference. 
The extrapolated distributions are fitted to Landau functions and are further compared to events from the \PYTHIA MC simulation. 
The obtained results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:wshapepred}. 
Within the limited statistical accuracy of this procedure, the Landau parameterization is indeed expected to be a good approximation of the \PW+jets contribution in the different event categories. 
However, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:wlanparams}, the parameters seem to differ in each category, 
and hence motivating separate width ($\sigma$) and most probable value (MPV) Landau parameters per category. 
It is though interesting to note that the $\sigma/\textrm{MPV}$ ratio is approximately the same possibly indicating that the intrinsic resolution is approximately the same. 
In the fit to the data Gaussian penalty terms are assigned to allow for a 5 (20)\% variation in the  $\sigma$ (MPV) with respect to the predictions in Table~\ref{tab:wlanparams}.

\subsubsection{\QCD\ multijet background}
\label{sec:bkg_QCD}

Typically, MC event simulation cannot properly reproduce the shape and normalization of the
\QCD\ multijet background, in particular, in the phase space of the analysis with an isolated and high-\pt lepton on top of four jets. 
Significantly high event count samples would also be required, and without any guarantee that the result
could be safely used as a description of this type of background, a data-based technique is applied.

A control region is selected in the $\mu$+jets final state by inverting the
isolation requirement for muons, i.e., $I_{\textrm{rel}}^{\mu}>0.2$, leaving all other identification requirements unchanged. 
The inverted cut value of 0.2 reflects a tradeoff between the event count and the contamination expected in the control region from non-\QCD\ processes, i.e., signal and \PW+jets events. 
In the $\mathrm{e}$+jets final state the electron candidate is required to fail a looser set of identification criteria, the so-called ``veto'' identification (Table~\ref{seltagandprobeeff}). 
A better estimate of the \QCD\ multijet background is found in the \texttt{ECAL} endcaps~\citeTH{topobs_CMS_jhep} where the fraction of nongenuine electrons is higher than the barrel. 
In both $\mu$+jets and $\mathrm{e}$+jets final states, the control regions contain no \cPqb-tagged jets to reduce the contamination from other non-\QCD\ processes, and hence are expected 
to be enriched mostly in \QCD\ multijet events.

Figure~\ref{fig:qcdparam} shows the distributions of the three mass variables, reconstructed in the \QCD\ multijet control regions. 
It is seen that the event count in the $\mathrm{e}$+jets is significantly higher than in $\mu$+jets final state, owing to the dominant contribution from nongenuine electrons.
Following the approach of~\citeTH{topobs_CMS_jhep} the shape of the \QCD\ multijet background is assumed to be the same in the control and signal regions. 
The shape is modeled with a nonparametric kernel approach~\cite{Cranmer:2000du}. 
A fair agreement is observed for all mass variables and categories.

}
\label{fig:qcdparam}
\end{figure}

The initial normalization of the \QCD\ multijet background is estimated from events with low $\ptmiss<20$\,\GeV. 
A fit is performed using the distributions of \QCD\ multijet, and \ttbar\ and \PW+jets processes derived from the control regions and MC simulation, respectively.  
The contributions from \ttbar\ and \PW+jets are left to float within 30\% of their initial estimates based on their theory cross sections. 
A 50-100\% systematic uncertainty is assigned to the result of the fit that is displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:qcdmetmetfits} separately for the $\mu$+jets and $\mathrm{e}$+jets final states. 
Although slight mismodeling is observed, the outcome of the fit serves the purpose of the data-based technique, i.e., to find an initial estimate for the number of \QCD\ multijet 
events fulfilling the analysis selection.  
Table~\ref{tab:qcdnorm} summarizes the number of \QCD\ multijet events estimated in each event category and the associated uncertainty which is used as a constraint 
when extracting the \ttbar\ cross section, as described in the following.
