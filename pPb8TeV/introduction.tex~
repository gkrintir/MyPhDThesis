Top quark cross sections at \texttt{LHC} are dominated by
pair production via gluon-gluon fusion processes ($\cPg\cPg\to \ttbar + \mathrm{X}$), and can be computed with great accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics~\cite{top++,mitov}. 
In proton-nucleus collisions, the top quark is a novel and theoretically precise probe of the nuclear gluon density at
high virtualities $\mathrm{Q}^2\approx m_\cPqt^2$ (where $m_\cPqt$ is the top quark mass) in the unexplored high Bjorken-$x$ 
region ($x\gtrsim 2m_\cPqt/\rootsNN \approx 0.05$)~\cite{dEnterria:2015jna,dEnterria:2017dum}. 
In this region,``antishadowing'' and ``EMC'' effects~\cite{Aubert:1983xm} are expected to modify the gluon density with 
respect to that in the free-proton case~\cite{EPS09,EPPS16}. %~\cite{Eskola:2009uj,Eskola:2016oht}.
The production of top quarks thus provides information on the nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF) that is complementary to that obtained through studies of electroweak boson production. In comparison to the \PW\ and \PZ\ cases~\cite{W_8TeV,Khachatryan:2015hha,Khachatryan:2015pzs}, 
top-pair cross sections are more sensitive to gluon (rather than quark) densities, at Bjorken-$x$ values about twice as large.
Novel studies of parton energy loss using top quarks in the quark-gluon plasma formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions have also been proposed~\cite{dEnterria:2015jna,Dainese:2016gch,Apolinario:2018}. 
A good understanding of top quark production in proton-nucleus collisions is crucial as a baseline for these studies.

%The  presents a typical signature of one isolated charged lepton and momentum imbalance from the unobserved neutrino in one \PW\ decay, 
%two light quark jets from the other \PW\ decay, and two b jets from the two original top quark decays. 
Since the $\ell$+jets final state features a large branching fraction ($\approx$34\% for the combined $\mathrm{e}$+jets and $\mu$+jets channels including events from the $\cPqt\to\PW\to\tau\to\Pe,\mu$ decay chain) and moderate background contamination it provides favorable conditions for the detection of \ttbar\ production in proton-nucleus collisions.
This Chapter describes the first observation of top quark production in nuclear collisions that is carried out with \pPb\ collisions collected by the \texttt{CMS} experiment at 
$\rootsNN = 8.16$\,\TeV, using \ttbar\ candidates. The event topology comprises exactly one isolated charged lepton, either a muon or an electron, 
accompanied by the presence of at least four jets, stemming from the hadronization of the \cPqb\ quarks, and of the light quarks from the decay of one of the \PW\ bosons.
The $\ttbar$ cross section is then extracted from a combined maximum likelihood fit of the invariant mass of the two light-quark jets, in different categories of events with zero, one, or at least two \cPqb-tagged jets.
