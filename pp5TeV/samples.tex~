\section{Data, simulated samples and theoretical cross section}
\label{sec:samples}

This analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of $27.4 \pm 0.6 \,\pbinv$~\citeTH{CMS-PAS-LUM-16-001}. 
The presence of multiple proton collisions in the same or nearby bunch crossings results in an average number of overlapping interactions estimated online to be 1.4, 
assuming a total inelastic cross section of 65\,$\mathrm{mb}$.

Several MC event generators are used to simulate signal and background events. The NLO \POWHEG~(v2)~\cite{powheg,powheg2,powheghvq} 
generator is used for \ttbar\ events, assuming a value of $172.5$\,\GeV\ for $m_{\textrm{top}}$. These events are passed to \PYTHIA~(v8.205)~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za,Sjostrand:2014zea}   
to simulate parton showering, hadronization, and  the underlying event, using the CUETP8M1~\cite{Khachatryan:2015pea,Skands:2014pea} tune for the default \ttbar\ MC sample.
The NNPDF3.0 NLO PDFs with strong coupling $\alpha_{\textrm{s}}(M_{\mathrm Z})=0.118$ at the Z boson mass scale $M_{\mathrm Z}$ are utilized in the MC calculations. 

The \amcatnlo~(v2.2.2) generator~\cite{amcatnlo} is used to simulate \PW boson production with additional jets (\PW+jets), and high-mass ($> 50$\,\GeV) Drell--Yan quark-antiquark
annihilation into lepton-antilepton pairs through Z boson or virtual-photon exchange (referred to as ``Z/$\gamma^{*}$''). 
The simulation includes up to two extra partons at matrix element level, and the \textsc{FxFx} merging scheme~\cite{fxfx} is used to interface with \PYTHIA. 
Low-mass Z/$\gamma^{*}$ events (20--50\,\GeV) are simulated with \PYTHIA. The normalization of the \PW+jets and Z/$\gamma^{*}$ processes is either derived from data (in the dilepton final state) 
or estimated based on the NNLO cross sections (in the $\ell$+jets final state) from the \FEWZ\ program (v3.1.b2)~\cite{fewz}.
Single top quark plus \PW boson events (\tW) are simulated using \POWHEG~(v1)~\cite{powheg1,powheg3} interfaced with \PYTHIA, 
and are normalized to the approximate NNLO cross sections~\cite{Kidonakis:2013zqa}. 
The diboson contributions from \WW and \WZ production (referred to as ``WV'') are simulated with \PYTHIA, and are normalized 
to the NLO cross sections calculated with the \mcfm~(v8.0) program~\cite{mcfm}. 
All generated events undergo a full \GEANTfour~\cite{geant4} simulation of the detector response. 
A complete overview of all used simulated sample can be found in Table~\ref{tab:mc_5TeV}.

The expected signal yields are normalized to the value of the SM prediction for the \ttbar\ production cross section:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:theory}
\sigma_{\tt}^{\mathrm{NNLO}} = 68.9\ ^{+1.9}_{-2.3}\,(\textrm{scale}) \pm 2.3\,\textrm{(PDF)}\ ^{+1.4}_{-1.0}\,(\alpha_{\textrm{s}})\,\mathrm{pb}\, ,
\end{equation}
as calculated with the \textsc{top++} program~\cite{top++} at NNLO in perturbative \QCD, including soft-gluon resummation 
at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic order~\cite{mitov}, using the NNPDF3.0 NNLO PDF set, with
$\alpha_{\textrm{s}}(M_{\mathrm Z})=0.118$ and $m_{\textrm{top}} = 172.5\,\GeV$.
The systematic uncertainty in the theoretical \ttbar\ cross section are associated with the choice of the renormalization ($\mu_{\textrm{R}}$) and factorization ($\mu_{\textrm{F}}$) scales---nominally set at $\mu_{\textrm{R}}=\mu_{\textrm{F}}=\sqrt{m_{\textrm{top}}^{2}+p_{\textrm{T},\textrm{top}}^{2}}$ with $p_{\textrm{T},\textrm{top}}$ the top quark transverse momentum---as well as with the PDF set and the $\alpha_{\textrm{s}}$ value.
The uncertainty of 0.1\% in the LHC beam energy~\cite{Wenninger:2254678} translates into an additional uncertainty of 0.22\,$\mathrm{pb}$ in the expected cross section, with negligible impact on the acceptance of any of the final states included in this analysis.

MC event generation employed in the measurement of the inclusive \stt in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=5.02\,\TeV~\citeAN{AN-16-098,AN-16-320,AN-16-369}; 
the samples are generated either inclusively or with a final state restricted to the leptonic mode, including electrons, muons, and $\mathit{tau}$ leptons. 
The absence of reference delineates cross section values calculated from the generator. 
For the samples restricted to specific decay channels, the branching ratio is included in the quoted cross section.
The  $M_{\ell\ell}>50\,\GeV$ ( $20<M_{\ell\ell}<50\,\GeV$) requirement has been applied on the MC event sample marked with \texttt{*} (\texttt{**}).
The \NNPDFzero NLO PDFs with strong coupling $\alpha_{\textrm{s}}(M_{\mathrm{Z}})=0.118$ at the Z boson mass scale $M_{\mattrm{Z}}$ are utilized in all the MC calculations.
