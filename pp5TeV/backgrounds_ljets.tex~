\subsection{The $\ell$+jets final state}
\label{sec:bkg_ljets}

In the $\ell$+jets analysis, the contributions of all background processes are estimated from simulation, 
excecpt for the \QCD\ multijet background. Owing to its large cross section,
there is a nonnegligible contribution from the latter faking a \ttbar\ event with $\ell$+jets in the final state.
Both the contribution from hard fragmentation of c and b quarks whose hadrons decay semileptonically,
and the contribution from misidentified leptons, such as from either punch-through hadrons or collimated jets with a high electromagnetic fraction,
can yield $\ell$+jets-like topologies.

The estimation of the \QCD\ multijet background is separately performed for the events with 0, 1, or $\geq\ $2 b jets
using a control region (CR) where either the muon candidate fails a looser isolation requirement ($I_\textrm{rel}^{\mu}<0.2$)
or the electron candidate fails the identification criteria.
The choice of the \QCD\ multijet control region has been made in such a way as to minimize the contamination attributable to the signal and W+jets events while retaining a large number of events in the sample for the estimation of this type of background.

The initial normalization of the \QCD\ multijet contribution in the signal region (SR) is derived from the ``reduced-signal region'' (RSR) of $\ptmiss<20\,\GeV$. 
Events in both the reduced-signal and control regions fulfilling this requirement are counted.
After subtracting the expected contributions from non-\QCD\ processes,
the ratio between the numbers of events observed in the reduced-signal region and in the control region,
\begin{equation}
N_{\textrm{SR}}(\QCD) = \left(N_{\textrm{CR}}\textrm{(obs)}-N_{\textrm{CR}}(\textrm{non-\QCD})\right)  \frac{N_{\textrm{RSR}}^{\ptmiss<20}\textrm{(obs)}-N_{\textrm{RSR}}^{\ptmiss<20}(\textrm{non-\QCD})}{N_{\textrm{CR}}^{\ptmiss<20}\textrm{(obs)}-N_{\textrm{CR}}^{\ptmiss<20}(\textrm{non-\QCD})}\, ,
\label{eq:qcdest}
\end{equation}
is used as a transfer factor to normalize the \QCD\ multijet background estimate.
In both the electron and muon final states, a 30\% uncertainty is assigned to the estimate of the expected contribution from non-\QCD\ processes, 
estimated after varying the \QCD\ scales in the W+jets simulation. This uncertainty propagates as both normalization and shape uncertainty in the predicted distributions 
for the \QCD\ multijet process. The variations are applied independently in the reduced-signal and control regions in order to determine an uncertainty envelope. 
A more accurate normalization for the \QCD\ multijet contribution is obtained by the fit performed to extract the final cross section, described in Section~\ref{sec:res_ljets}.

Figures~\ref{fig:metmu} shows the \ptmiss distributions in SR for $mu$+jets and $\mathrm{e}$+jets final states, respectively. 
For validation the transverse mass (\mtw) of the lepton--\vecptmiss system,
\begin{linenomath}\begin{equation}\label{eq:mt}
\mtw = \sqrt{2\ptmiss \pt^{\mathrm{lepton}} (1 - \mathrm{cos}\Delta\phi)}\, ,
\end{equation}\end{linenomath}
is displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:mtmu} for the same event categories and final states. 
In both cases, the distributions in these exclusive events, i.e., requiring two non-\cPqb-tagged jets plus 0, 1 or at least 2 \cPqb-tagged jets, 
a fair agreement is observed in both variables. 
For higher number of \cPqb-tagged jets, the expected contamination from non-\QCD\ processes tends to be larger.
