\InitialCharacter{A}fter the discovery of the top quark more than 20 years ago, top quark production cross sections, increasingly dominated by gluon fusion processes with higher center-of-mass energies, 
have been meticulously studied using hadron-hadron collisions. 
The rich variety of results from the \texttt{LHC} experiments are complemented with increasingly accurate theoretical predictions of heavy quark production and decay. 
Measurements of the top quark production provide a benchmark test of the standard model at energy scales much larger than those typically 
involved for the other quarks. The large top quark mass ($m_{\textrm{top}}$), which lies remarkably close to the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, 
sets a scale for higher order perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics (\QCD).

The proton structure can be extensively probed combining measurements of top quark production at various center-of-mass energies since they exhibit sensitivity on different values 
of Bjorken $x\gtrsim 2m_{\textrm{top}}/\sqrt{s}$, and hence can provide complementary information on the gluon distribution, as well as light quarks. 
The energies and large data samples available at \texttt{LHC} have already allowed to measure various large-mass elementary particles, for the first time, in nuclear collisions. 
Compared to hadron-hadron collisions, and based on parametrizations of nuclear modifications to the free nucleon densities, 
the inclusive top pair production is expected to be mildly enhanced because of an overall net gluon antishadowing, 
with different regions of their differential distributions being depleted as a result of shadowing or \texttt{EMC}-effect corrections. 
Novel physics opportunities are, in turn, opened up such as constraints of nuclear parton densities in less explored kinematic ranges, 
and studies of the dynamics of heavy-quark energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma, a deconfined \QCD\ state of matter.
